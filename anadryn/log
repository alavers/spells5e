The Hunt for Hamoncost the Necro
================================
Spoke to old adventurer Eadermarth orchard Darren, previously kept eye on Hamoncost
Was looking for laylines, told us about a third one under a tower in the ruined town of thundertree
We're headed west to pick up the trail

We fuck around and can't find a horse

We arrive at the triboar trial
We head west in search of Thundertree

at night we spot undead shambling north

After another night's rest we find the tower!

we are 200-300 feet away
send meatwad 5 goes in to investigate
    see warning sign to turn back
    see abandoned houses & a pair of cottages, and inn
    a spider eats meatwad

We climb up the tower hill to avoid the spider and take Hamoncost by surprise
An idle horde of zombies is in the town square
A fucking young dragon is in the tower. Chunston stumbles on it and it flies out to fuck us up
Hamoncost shows up and says "It's too soon!". He sucks up his zombies somehow and peaces out through a portal
The dragon fucks up Anadryn pretty bad. But we fuck it up pretty bad too. It flies off.



Thundertree Loot:

Haul (each);
(added) 200 silver
(added) 70 gold

(taken) wand of war mage +1 to attack roll

Went into house Hammond Cost was in, found many acolytes who died from magical means (no physical damage)
One acolyte found dead over a ritual book, a "dreadring", a ritual modified from raising the dead
The dead people here appear to be some kind of dragon club

Found:
-3 diamonds each (added)
-potion of flying

==REIDOTH ENCOUNTER==
Reidoth (Pycellesque man) approaches and thanks us for driving off the Dragon.
eruption in thundertree was 50 yrs
dragon took over a week or two ago
Found a cavern under the town that might be why people were raising from the dead (lay line)
Spiders have been there for a long time
Wizard's tower was once inhabited (wizard Iwyn Udipius is dead, fighting the first wave of undead)
Statue is the hero of Neverwinter Pallien, founder of the village

Summon Meatwad VI

Hammond is from Thay
Dread ring ritual is to kill a bunch of things and generate a bunch of undead and horde them like batteries
We go to bed

==THE NEXT DAY==
Reidoth leads us to the cavern. He found it because the animals were avoiding it
There is a plant monster there.
We defeat it, at great cost :(
